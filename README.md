# Hymnes et Cantiques App

This is a mobile application developed in React Native and Expo for viewing the songs from the "Hymnes et Cantiques" Kinyarwanda version. The app allows users to navigate through a list of songs and view song details.

## Features

1. **Song List Screen**: Displays a list of all the songs. Users can search songs by title or song number.
2. **Song Detail Screen**: Displays the details of a selected song. The song number, title, subtitle, and verses are shown. Users can swipe left or right to navigate to the previous or next song.

## Data

The songs are stored in a JSON file, songs.json, which was generated by a Python parser from a .txt file containing the lyrics. The format of the data in the JSON file is as follows:
```json
[
    {
        "song_number": 1,
        "title": "TURAGUSINGIZA DATA",
        "sub_title": "N'icyubahiro",
        "verses": [
            "\n1. Turagusingiza Data,...",
            "2. Watuviriye nk'umucyo,..."
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```
